HTMLEmailsTemplate
==========

When I was creating my first so called HTML Email for a client, I got to know that template of Emails sucked up like anything. 

So folks, here is a template I FINALLY Created. 

Features:
=========
Its basically an Invoice: *I really wish I could attach an email screen shot here*
It uses loop to create dynamic HTML Table. 
It uses PHP variables to display dynamic data in Emails

How to Use:
===========
1. copy the code in your .php file through which you are going to send the email.
2. change ALL THE VARIABLES. I'll recommend to use find freature on your editor to find all the Php variables i have used in the code to change them so there is no chance of error left.


In case of any help kindly leave a word.
