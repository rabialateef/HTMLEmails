HTMLEmails
==========

When I was creating my first so called HTML Email for a client, I got to know that template of Emails sucked up like anything. 
I struggled in making up this basic email template as an INVOIVCE that will generate user selected data from the JQUERY form and will email the invoice to user. 

To use this template, just change the php varialbes used.
